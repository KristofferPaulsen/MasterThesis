21,Hey did you ever hear back from your boss about that promotion?,1
21,Yeah… I got the email this morning.,1
21,And...? Don’t keep me in suspense. What did it say?,1
21,They gave it to Mark. Again.,1
21,What?! Are you kidding me? That’s the third time!,1
21,I know. I seriously don’t get it. I’ve led two major projects this quarter and he barely showed up to the last team meeting.,1
21,That’s total garbage. You deserve better than that place.,1
21,Yeah… it just hurts you know? You give so much of yourself and it’s like none of it matters.,1
21,I’m so sorry Aiden. You work so hard. It’s not your fault their priorities are messed up.,1
21,Thanks. It means a lot coming from you. Honestly I don’t know what I’d do without you sometimes.,1
21,Hey don’t make me cry over here. You know I’ve got your back always.,1
21,You’re the only part of today that hasn’t completely sucked.,1
21,Want to blow off steam? Ice cream loud music screaming into a pillow? You name it.,1
21,Honestly? That sounds amazing. Ice cream and yelling? Perfect therapy.,1
21,Deal. But wait—before we go I have to tell you something.,1
21,What now? Hopefully not more bad news?,1
21,No! Good news for once. My short film—remember the one I submitted last month? It got accepted into the festival!,1
21,No way! Lena that’s incredible! I’m so proud of you!,1
21,Thanks! I honestly didn’t think I had a shot. I almost didn’t send it in.,1
21,Are you kidding? You’re brilliant. I’ve seen your work—this is just the beginning.,1
21,Thanks Aiden. And don’t worry… your beginning’s coming too. You’re too good to stay unrecognized forever.,1
22,Hey have you heard from Noah today? He didn’t show up for class and hasn’t replied to any messages.,1
22,No I haven’t. That’s weird. He never just disappears like that.,1
22,Exactly. I called him twice—straight to voicemail. I’m starting to get kind of scared.,1
22,Maybe his phone died? Or he’s just taking a mental health day? He’s been pretty stressed lately.,1
22,Yeah... maybe. But it’s just not like him. He always at least sends a quick text.,1
22,I’ll swing by his place after class just to be sure.,1
22,You’d do that? Thank you. I don’t know why I’m this anxious but something just feels off.,1
22,You care about him. That’s not a bad thing. Honestly I was worried too but didn’t want to say,1
22,We’re such a mess huh?,1
22,Maybe. But we’re a mess that looks out for each other.,1
22,That means more than you know.,1
22,Okay wait—he just texted. Said he had a migraine and slept through the day.,1
22,Oh my god. I could cry.,1
22,I was ready to break down his door.,1
22,I love that we’re both this dramatic when we care.,1
22,I’ll own it. Better dramatic than distant right?,1
22,Exactly. I’m gonna bring him soup tomorrow. Want to come with?,1
22,Absolutely. Drama team reporting for comfort duty.,1
22,Maybe we should bake cookies too—he always smiles when we do that.,1
22,Good idea. Let’s go full-on cozy squad.,1
22,Perfect. He’s lucky to have us—and honestly I think we’re lucky to have each other too.,1
